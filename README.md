# Vite Electron DNS

A modern, high-performance DNS and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) benchmarking desktop application powered by **Electron**, **Vite+**, **React 19**, **Adobe React Spectrum**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **TanStack Query**.

Designed for deterministic DNS evaluation across preset and custom resolvers, featuring native multi-target builds, sub-second HMR with automated process hot-restart, and zero third-party Electron wrapper meta-frameworks.

---

## Highlights

- **Strict Quality Gate**: Unified verification gate (`vpr agent:verify:gate`) executing strict TypeScript, Oxlint, Oxfmt, Knip dead-code audit, dual-track testing, Vite+ multi-target builds, and Electron packaging validation.
- **Vite+ & Rolldown**: Built directly with standard Vite+ (1.0) and Rolldown for sub-second builds across main, preload, and renderer.
- **Hot-Restart & Dev Runner**: Native Vite+ dev runner (`vp dev`) providing true process hot-restart on main process changes, window reload on preload edits, and component-level HMR for renderer.
- **Dual-Track Testing**: Component tests execute in headless Chromium browser mode via `@vitest/browser-playwright`, while main process, DNS resolver, and type contract tests run in Node.js.
- **Agent-First Workflow**: Clear architectural boundaries, strict coding rules, and TDD workflow documented in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
- **Process Isolation & Security**: Safe context bridge exposition ensuring raw Node.js internals and IPC channels remain isolated from the renderer.

## CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

- **Tiered Daily CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)**:
  - **Tier 1 (`gatekeeper`)**: Runs on `ubuntu-latest` against the authoritative Node.js runtime (`package.json`). Executes dependencies installation, Playwright browser caching, the full verification gate (`vp check`, `agent:verify:inner`, `check:deadcode`, `agent:test:unit`, `build:all`, `app:pack`), Linux distribution packaging (`app:linux`), and full headless Electron E2E smoke testing (`xvfb-run vp run agent:test:e2e`).
  - **Tier 2 (`platform-compat`)**: Executes only after `gatekeeper` succeeds across `windows-latest` and `macos-latest`. Validates production builds (`build:all`), native compiler bindings (Rolldown, LightningCSS), runtime path compatibility (`agent:test:unit`), and platform distribution packaging (`app:mac`, `app:win`) without duplicating static checks or heavy E2E journeys.
- **Proactive Node Canary (`.github/workflows/node-canary.yml`)**:
  - Scheduled weekly cron job targeting upcoming Node.js releases (Node 26 line) with `--engine-strict=false` and `continue-on-error: true` to detect upstream regressions early without breaking repository status badges.
